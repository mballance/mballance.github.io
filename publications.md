## PyVSC: SystemVerilog-Style Constraints and Coverage in Python

**Publication:** Workshop on Open-source EDA Technology (WOSET) 2020

***Abstract -*** Constrained-randomization and functional 
coverage are key elements in the widely-used SystemVerilog-based 
verification flow. The use of Python in functional verification is 
growing in popularity, but Python has historically lacked support 
for the constraint and coverage features provided by 
SystemVerilog. This paper describes PyVSC, a library that 
provides these features.
