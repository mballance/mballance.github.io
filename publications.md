## PyVSC: SystemVerilog-Style Constraints and Coverage in Python

**Publication:** Workshop on Open-source EDA Technology (WOSET) 2020

***Abstract -*** Constrained-randomization and functional 
coverage are key elements in the widely-used SystemVerilog-based 
verification flow. The use of Python in functional verification is 
growing in popularity, but Python has historically lacked support 
for the constraint and coverage features provided by 
SystemVerilog. This paper describes PyVSC, a library that 
provides these features.

## Introducing your team to an IDE

**Publication:** DVCon 2019

***Abstract - *** Text editors like Vi and EMACS have been replaced by 
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for developing applications 
in software languages such as C, C++, and Java. IDEs boost code 
development productivity by putting information from across large codebases 
at the user's fingertips, prompting users with context-sensitive 
information, providing navigation based on the semantics of the language, 
and in general, simplifying the process of working with large and 
complex software projects. 
This paper assumes that the reader understands the productivity gains an 
IDE brings to an organization and is looking to introduce an IDE to their 
organization or team. The paper focuses on some of the challenges that need to 
be addressed to ensure a successful adoption of an IDE into a new organization 
after a brief overview of some of the benefits an IDE provides.

## Unleashing Portable Stimulus Productivity with a PSS Reuse Strategy

**Publication:** DVcon 2019

***Abstract - *** Creating sufficient tests to verify today’s complex designs 
is a key verification challenge, and this challenge is present from 
IP block-level verification all the way to SoC validation. The Accellera Portable 
Test and Stimulus Standard (PSS) promises to boost verification reuse by allowing 
a single description of test intent to be reused across IP block, subsystem, and 
SoC verification environments, and provides powerful language features to address 
verification needs across the verification levels and address the specific requirement 
of verification reuse. However, much as powerful object-oriented features in the 
Java and C++ languages didn’t automatically result in high-quality reusable code, 
the PSS standard’s language features on their own do not guarantee productive reuse 
of test intent. Judiciously applied, reuse of design IP and test intent can dramatically 
reduce rework and avoid mistakes introduced during the rework process. In addition, 
just as reuse of design IP accelerates the creation of new designs, reuse of test 
intent accelerates the creation or new test scenarios. However, effective reuse of 
test intent requires up-front planning, in the same way that reuse of design IP 
or software code does. Without a well-planned process, reuse can backfire and 
require more work without providing proportionate benefits. This paper will help 
you to design a PSS reuse strategy that matches the goals and profile of your 
organization, and maximizes the benefits you receive by adopting PSS.
