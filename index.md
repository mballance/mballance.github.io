Professionally, I work as a silicon design engineer at AMD, with a focus on 
functional verification methodology and verification.

Over the preceeding 20+ years in the EDA industry, I've worked in product 
development, marketing, and management roles in the areas of 
hardware/software co-verification, transaction-level modeling, IP 
encapsulation and reuse, and Portable Test and Stimulus.

A key industry focus from 2014 to present has been standardization of
the [Accellera Portable Stimulus Standard](https://www.accellera.org/activities/working-groups/portable-stimulus).
The Portable Stimulus Specification (PSS) is
a model-based capture of test intent that enables automated 
generation of random scenario-level tests. While there are 
many potential applications for such tests, a key target is
creation of software-driven SoC-level tests for verifying 
proper integration, performance, and power.

Much of my work has focused on early stange technologies, with an emphasis
on helping users understand how best to incorporate these new technologies
into their existing design and verification flows.

I have a deep personal interest in functional verification methodologies and 
techniques, and contribute to several open source projects in that domain. 

## Publications
I enjoy writing about the work I'm doing, and enjoy presenting 
at conferences. You can find a [list of publications here](publications.html). 

I maintain a [blog for my personal projects](https://bitsbytesgates.com/)
where I write about new things I'm exploring, and enhancements
I'm making to the various side projects that I work on. 

## Personal Projects

I always have at least one (and typically several) personal
open-source project running. I love learning new things, and
find that projects are the perfect way for me to learn. Given my
interest in hardware/gateware and functional verification, 
my projects, unsurprisingly, focus on this space.
